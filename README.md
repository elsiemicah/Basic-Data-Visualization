# Basic-Data-Visualization: E-commerce Customer Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce customer data to identify key factors that impact yearly spending. By using basic data visualization techniques, we uncover insights into customer behavior and spending patterns. The findings can be used to develop strategies for increasing customer engagement and maximizing revenue.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

Avg. Session Length: Average session time on the app/website in minutes.
Time on App: Time spent on the mobile app in minutes.
Time on Website: Time spent on the website in minutes.
Length of Membership: Duration of customer membership in years.
Yearly Amount Spent: Total amount spent by the customer per year in USD.
Key Insights
Using data visualizations, the following insights were identified:

Positive Correlation: A strong positive correlation between Length of Membership and Yearly Amount Spent.
App Usage: Customers spending more time on the app also tend to spend more yearly.
Distribution: The distribution of Yearly Amount Spent is fairly normal, with most customers clustered around a central spending range.
Heatmap Analysis: Key correlations were found, confirming Length of Membership and Time on App as strong predictors of spending.
Visualizations
Scatter Plot: Relationship between Length of Membership and Yearly Amount Spent.
Histogram: Distribution of Yearly Amount Spent.
Box Plot: Comparison of Time on App and Yearly Amount Spent.
Pair Plot: Relationships among multiple variables.
Heatmap: Correlation matrix of numerical features.
