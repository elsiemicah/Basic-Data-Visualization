# Basic-Data-Visualization: E-commerce Customer Analysis

Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce customer data to identify key factors that impact yearly spending. By using basic data visualization techniques, we uncover insights into customer behavior and spending patterns. The findings can be used to develop strategies for increasing customer engagement and maximizing revenue.

Decision:

Through visualizations, including scatter plots, histograms and correlation heatmaps, we identify the main features that impact customer spending. This analysis is useful for developing strategies to retain long-term members. This is the first step and the second step will be how to retain members.
